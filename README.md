Play interactive past Jeopardy games taken from jarchive (WIP)

Currently only have webscraper for jarchive done, taking past Jeopardy games and getting the data (questions, answers, categories, etc.) to be used for future site.
Planning to make database to store retrieved games (to not constantly request) and functional site to play the games.
